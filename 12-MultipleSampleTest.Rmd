# Multiple sample test {}
This chapter describes the mathematical approach to check for differences among independent groups, or so-call ANOVA test (or Analysis of Variance). Although the name of the technique refers to variances, the main goal of ANOVA is to investigate differences among means.


There are numerous ways in which you can look for differences among groups, which will determine the type of ANOVA to use. Lets check some examples, to clarify the distinctions.

Say the International Olympic Association wants to endorse an energy drink for its athletes and two different companies send samples of their products.A first, order question could be if the drinks make any difference in the endurance of their athletes. And you can compare, say the times running 100m for groups of athletes given the two types of drinks and a control given water. In this case, you want tot test, if at least one of the three groups is different, and in this case, you will use what is call a **one-way ANOVA**. You only have one factor, which is the drink type. 

```{r, out.width = "70%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Z-test or T-test?'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/OneWayAnova.png")
```


Say, however, that you are also interested in knowing if such an effect varies between men and females. In this case, you have two factors and you will need to know the effect of the drink and the effect of gender. For this type of cases, you will use what is called a two-way ANOVA.You have two factors (drink type and gender). 


```{r, out.width = "70%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center',fig.cap = 'Z-test or T-test?'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TwoWayAnova.png")
```

In this course, we will study only one-way  ANOVAS. You should also be aware that to run an ANOVA you need to test for different key assumptions.

1. The data are normally distributed. As mentioned earlier, this assumption is key to all types of parametric tests. Basically we need to know the data follows a bell shape, such that we can approximates the distribution of data.

2. The variances among the different groups have to be homogeneous, or so-call homogeneity of variance.As we will learn soon, ANOVA is bassed on the ratio the variance between groups and the variance within groups. So if variances are non homogeneous among groups this could bias the ANOVA test.

3. The observations are independent.

4. No outliers are present.


At the end of this chapter, you are expected to:

1. Run an ANOVA in R, and interpret its results
2. Run a post-hoc test, identify differences among specific pairs of samples.

## Homework {-}

For each of the problems below do:

1. State the null and alternative hypothesis.
2. will this be a one tail or two-tail test?
3. Indicate the type of test to use (Z-test or T-test).
4. Run the given test in R.
5. Report your results on top of a publication quality plot.
6. Describe your conclusion.

**Problem 1:**
Two competing headache remedies claim to give fast-acting relief. An experiment was performed to compare the mean lengths of time required for bodily absorption of brand A and brand B headache remedies. The lengths of time in minutes for the drugs to reach a specified level in the blood were recorded. Results were are follow:

Brand A: Mean time= 21.8 min; sd= 8.7 min; n=500

Brand B: Mean time= 18.9 min; sd= 7.5 min; n=350

Are the two drugs different?. test this at a significance level of 0.05

**Problem 2:**
A consumer group is testing two camp stoves. To test the heating capacity of a stove, it measures the time required to bring 2 quarts of water from 50Â°F to boiling (at sea level). The following results are obtained:

Model 1: Mean time = 11.4 min; sd= 2.5 min; n= 10 stoves

Model 2: Mean time = 9.9 min; s2=3.0 min; n=12 stoves

Assume that the time required to bring water to a boil is normally distributed for each stove.  Is there any difference between the performances of these two models? Use a 5% level of significance.
