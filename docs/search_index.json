[["9-standard-hyphostesis-tests.html", "9 Standard hyphostesis tests", " 9 Standard hyphostesis tests In the prior chapter, we learned that the basic principle of hypothesis testing was to find out if a given value (from a sample) was on the extremes of a population. The threshold for what we mean by extreme is determined by the \\(\\alpha\\) value. We can test a hypothesis by brutal force running a simulation, but we can also run a set of available tests that will tell you the position of your sample in relation to the population. There are a diversity of statistical tests available for testing hypotheses, but here we will deal only with those tests intended to test if one thing, two things or more than two things are different. By the way, the suitability of available tests depends on whether your data are normally distributed or not (please recall from chapter 3 that normally distributed data looks like a bell-shape curve). Tests for normally distributed data are call parametric tests. In cases, where your data are not normal (e.g., it is biased, or homogeneous) requires a different set of tests called non-parametric tests. We will not cover non-parametric here but you need to be aware of this distinction. Expectation for this chapter At the end of this chapter, it is expected that you can identify the case you want to test (i.e., one, two or more sample tests), and select the proper statistical method to test for significant differences for each case. "],["alternative-types-of-tests.html", "Alternative types of tests", " Alternative types of tests When comparing samples, in broad terms, there are three likely options: One sample test This type of case relates to situations in which you have a sample parameter and you want to compare it a population. Say you are disappointed by how much smaller the candy bars in a store look like. Say you take a few samples of candy bars and found they are on average 180g. The label says they are on average 200g +/-10g. This would be a case of a one-sample test. Basically, you have one sample and you want to find out if it is different to the expected value from a population. Lets visualize this: SampleWeight=180 # this is the average weight of the samples you took PopulationWeight=200 # Average weight reported in the lable of the candy bar SD=10 # reported Standard deviation for the candy bars SimulatedPopulation&lt;- rnorm(10000,PopulationWeight,SD) #lets simulate a population of 10000 candy bars with . breaks = seq(150, 250, length.out = 80) #I create a set of bins for the x-axis of the distribution, this will determine how many bis you have #next I plot the data hist(SimulatedPopulation, main=NA,xlim=c(150, 250),ylim=c(0, 800),breaks = breaks, xlab = &quot;Candy bar weight (g)&quot;,ylab = &quot;Number of candies&quot;) #plot the mean height of men abline(v=SampleWeight, lwd=2, col=&quot;red&quot;, lty=2) #lets add a label to mean label text(SampleWeight,2000,labels=&quot;Sample&quot;,pos=4, col=&quot;blue&quot;) Two sample test These are cases when you want to compare samples from two different populations. Say you have noted that when you fuel-up your at a gas station A, you can take on average one more trip to work than when you fuelup your car at gas station B. You can suspect one of the gas stations is adding more gas or actually giving less gas than it is suppose to. You can report this to the consumer group, and a likely test will be to take say samples of one gallon from both gas stations and measure the actual volume they dispense. Say a sample of 50 trials yeilds valumes of 1.1 gal +/-.05gal in Gas station A and 1.01 gal +/-.02gal in Gas station B. This is a case of a two-sample test. In this case, you can treat both samples as independent, and assume they come from independent populations that are the same. Lets visualize this: MeanGasA=1.1 # average gas volume for a suspected 1 gallon dispensing at gas station A SDGasA=0.05 # SD for sample from gas station A MeanGasB=1.01 # average gas volume for a suspected 1 gallon dispensing at gas station B SDGasB=0.02 # SD for sample from gas station B SimulatedGasA&lt;- rnorm(10000,MeanGasA,SDGasA) #lets simulate a population for gas station A. SimulatedGasB&lt;- rnorm(10000,MeanGasB,SDGasB) #lets simulate a population for gas station A. breaks = seq(0.5, 1.5, length.out = 100) #I create a set of bins for the x-axis of the distribution, this will determine how many bis you have #next I plot the data. because we want to plot two distributions on top of each other. we need to create each distribution independently and then add them to a single plot #histogram for gass station A. GasA= hist(SimulatedGasA, xlim=c(0.5, 1.5),ylim=c(0, 1500),breaks = breaks, plot = FALSE) #histogram for gass station B. GasA= hist(SimulatedGasB, xlim=c(0.5, 1.5),ylim=c(0, 1000),breaks = breaks, plot = FALSE) #lets plot the first distribution plot(GasA, main=NA,xlim=c(0.5, 1.5),ylim=c(0, 1000),breaks = breaks, xlab = &quot;Dispensed gas volume for a reported 1 gallon (in gallons)&quot;,ylab = &quot;Number of trials&quot; ) Figure 9.1: Selecting statistical test "],["the-z-score.html", "The Z-score", " The Z-score As it has been indicated several times in this book, it is relatively easy to know the proportion of individuals in a population at certain standard deviations from the mean.
