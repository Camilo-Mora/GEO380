[["10-one-sample-tests.html", "10 One sample tests", " 10 One sample tests One sample tests are for cases in which you have one sample, and what to determine if it belongs to a certain population. Like: is it the gas in Hawaii significantly more expensive than the rest of the USA?. is a 10 year old girl taller than expected? These types of questions can be answered with either the Z-test or the T-Test, which we will introduce in this chapter. Both of these tests are suited for one-sample test, but the Z-test is used for cases in which you know the population standard deviation (SD) and your sample size is larger than 30 observations. If on the contrary, you do not know your population SD or your sample size is smaller than 30 observations, then you used the T-Test. Figure 10.1: Z-score fucntion At the end of this chapter, you are expected to: Run a one sample Z-test and interpret its results from R. Run a one sample T-test and interprets its results from R. "],["the-one-sample-z-test-by-hand.html", "The one-sample Z-test by hand", " The one-sample Z-test by hand As mentioned earlier, the Z-test is used in cases when you want to run a one-sample test, you know the population standard deviation and your sample size is larger than 30 individuals. (grabs this token L). The principle of the Z-score is very straightforward. Basically, this score allows you to know how many Standard deviations from the mean a given sample is. As it has been indicated several times in this book, it is relatively easy to know the proportion of individuals in a population at certain standard deviations from the mean (when the data are normally distributed, of course). As an example, plus or minus two standard deviations from the mean includes about 95% of the individuals in that population (assuming the population is normally distributed). Given this principle then you can easily know the fraction of individuals at certain standard deviations from the mean. The z-cores is basically an index that allows you to convert/standardize any value to a given number of standard deviations from the mean. Figure 10.2: Z-test fucntion Lets try an example. Say you want to know if the USA female team run particularly slower the 100m race than prior teams. You studied 31 girls of the current team and their times runing 100m in seconds were: 9.7, 9.7, 8.9, 9.2, 9.4, 9.1, 9.5, 9.6, 8.9, 9.1, 9.5, 9.2, 9.5, 9.4, 9.6, 9.2, 9.9, 10, 9.3, 9.6, 9.1, 9.5, 9.2, 9.5, 9.4, 9.6, 9.2, 9.9, 10, 9.3, 9.6. In turn, the historical time running that race is 9.5sec +/-0.2sec. From the example, it looks like we have one sample that we want to compare to a population. We have the standard deviation, SD, of the population and our sample size is larger than 30, so the best test here is a Z-test. As it is customary, we start by stating the hypothesis: H0: Time USA team &gt;= 9.5 sec The null hypothesis is how things are suppose to be or everything that the alternative hypothesis is not …that means, the historical time of 9.5sec or larger H1: Time USA team &lt; 9.5 sec The alternative hypothesis is what we are interested on, or claiming…that the USA team is slower than 9.5sec Let’s calculate the z-score: Sample=c(9.7, 9.7, 8.9, 9.2, 9.4, 9.1, 9.5, 9.6, 8.9, 9.1, 9.5, 9.2, 9.5, 9.4, 9.6, 9.2, 9.9, 10, 9.3, 9.6, 9.1, 9.5, 9.2, 9.5, 9.4, 9.6, 9.2, 9.9, 10, 9.3, 9.6) #lets put the values in a vector SampleMean=mean(Sample) #mean time racing for the girls sampled SampleSize= length(Sample) # this is the sample size or number of girls measured #from the mean alone, we can see that this girls are slower than historical times...so a hint that someting may be right about our hyphothesis SampleMean ## [1] 9.43871 PopulationMean= 9.5 #this is the population mean...or the historical time it has taken people to run 100m PopulationSD=0.2 #this is the population standard deviation #let&#39;s now estimate the z-score using the equation above. ZTest=(SampleMean-PopulationMean)/(PopulationSD/sqrt(SampleSize)) ZTest ## [1] -1.70625 Now you need to recall chapter 8 to find out if this is a left-, right- or two tail test. If you have forgotten, check the video as a refreshers: Because, our alternative hypothesis is stating that the sample is smaller than, then we have to use a left-sided test. Figure 10.3: Types of tests And with that you should look for the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) in a Z-table of a left-sided test, like this one below (These tables are in the back of each stats book and online). The Z-table would give you the p-value for a given Z-value…in other words, what fraction of the population is beyond the given z-score. Figure 10.4: Left-sided Z-table To find out the p-value for a given Z-score in the left-sided Z-table, scroll down the first column looking for the first decimal point in your calculated z-score. In our case that will be -1.7. Once on that row, go back to the first row, and move horizontally until the column with the second decimal point in your calculated Z-score, which in our case is 0. Basically, you are looking for the value at the interception between the first decimal point in your calculated z-score indicated in the first column, and the second decimal of your z-score indicated in the first row of the Z-table. In our case, the p-value for a Z-score of -1.70 is 0.0446. What that tells you is that the girls in the USA team are as slow as the bottom 4.46% of all historical teams. If we compare our significance level, \\(\\alpha\\), of 0.05, to our calculated p-value of 0.0446, you can observed that the p-value is smaller than the \\(\\alpha\\), so the Ho (null hypothesis) must go. Basically, we reject the null hypothesis that the 100m run time of this team is 9.5sec or higher and conclude that these girls indeed run slower than the historical average. "],["the-one-sample-z-test-in-r.html", "The one-sample Z-test in R", " The one-sample Z-test in R We can run such a test in R, using the package BSDA, and its function z.test.

This function ask for the confidence level, which as we indicated before is the complement to the level of significance we use, in our case our significance level is 0.05, so the confidence level will be 0.95 The results will look like the image below, which are nearly identical to our hand calculation. a Figure 10.5: R-results for a one-sample z-test "],["the-one-sample-t-test-by-hand.html", "The one-sample T-test by hand", " The one-sample T-test by hand We perform a one-Sample t-test when we want to compare a sample mean with the population mean and we do not know the population standard deviation or our sample size is small, n &lt; 30. The difference from the Z Test is that we do not have the information on Population Variance here. We use the sample standard deviation instead of population standard deviation in this case. Figure 10.6: R-results for a one-sample z-test Lets try an example. Let’s say we want to determine if on average girls score more than 600 points in a given exam. We do not have the information related to variance (or standard deviation) for girls’ scores, so we take randomly the scores of 10 girls. We choose our \\(\\alpha\\) value (significance level) to be 0.05. The scores for the ten girl were: 587, 602, 627, 610, 619, 622, 605, 608, 596, 592. Lets’ set the hypothesis H0: \\(\\mu\\) =&lt; 600 the true or expected value H1: \\(\\mu\\) &gt; 600 the question of interest, which in this case is to know if the girsl scored higher In this case, we have a one-sample comparison, we do not know the population variance, and our sample size is only 10 individuals, so a T-test is best suited here. Let’s do one by hand, Sample=c(587, 602, 627, 610, 619, 622, 605, 608, 596, 592) #lets put the values in a vector SampleMean=mean(Sample) #mean score of the girls sampled SampleSD=sd(Sample) #this is the sample standard deviation SampleSize= length(Sample) # this is the sample size PopulationMean= 600 #this is the true, expected value, think of it as the population mean... #let&#39;s now estimate the T-score using the equation above. TTest=(SampleMean-PopulationMean)/(SampleSD/sqrt(SampleSize)) TTest So our estimated T-value is 1.64. Now, we need to find out the critical t-value at the 0.05 significance level. For this, we need to estimate something call Degrees of freedom, which in this case is simply our sample size minus one. In our case, the degrees of freedom, then, are 9. With the information of the \\(\\alpha\\) value (i.e., 0.05 in our case) and the degrees of freedom, DF (i.e, 9 in our case), we can look for the critical T-value in a table, like the one below. Basically, scroll down the first column looking for 9 DF, then move horizontally to the column displaying the 0.05 level of significance, where they intercept that is our critical t-value. In our case that number is 1.8331. Figure 10.7: R-results for a one-sample z-test Our critical t-value for 9DF and \\(\\alpha\\)=0.05 is 1.8331. This means 5% of the given population are above a T-value of 1.8331. In our case, the calculated t-value was 1.64, which is smaller than the critical value, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis and don’t have enough evidence to support the hypothesis that on average, girls score more than 600 in the exam. There is only one T-table for cases of left-, right-, or two-tail test. When in need of a left-side score, simply remove the sign and look for the critical t-value in the table above. This is because the T-distribution is symmetric from the mean: it is the same right or left. When in need of a two-tail test, divide the significance level by 2, and look for that value in the T-table. Say, you are using a significance level of 0.05 testing an alternative hypothesis of something being different, then you will be running a two-tail test, meaning you will be looking to see if your sample value is on either tail of the population distribution. In this case, you need to divide the significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)) by 2 to account for the fact that you are checking the two-tails of the distribution.
